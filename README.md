## UZD

UZD is a rebase token with a balance that grows in proportion to Zunami Protocol APY. UZD is over-colaterized by stablecoins, which are allocated in Curve Finance pools and minted using the ZLP. UZD is secure from depeg, since it can be redeemed with USDT/USDC/DAI at any time. The user can receive UZD using mint through the Zunami interface, as well as using the swap in the Curve. 

UZD perfectly solves the stablecoin trilemma. It's decentralized as it's collateralized by a set of various stable crypto assets. It's protected from depeg by the mechanism of instant redemption. UZD is highly capital-efficient due to the native APY from the best pools on Curve. 

You can enjoy the passive income even with passive storage in their wallet, or put it into the UZD+3CRV or UZDFRAXBP pools and multiply their profitability many times over.
